JuggleKeys is a collection of scripts working all together, made to improve the user experience on Windows systems by allowing many great features over the OS (especially in french).
To use it, you must first install AutoHotkey that you can find at http://www.autohotkey.com

You must also configure the file JuggleKeys.ini, but keep in mind that the default configuration will already work properly.
Just launch 'JuggleKeys.ahk', and you'll see the application menu icon in the systray.

You'll find more information about JuggleKeys on http://www.jugglemaster.fr/computing/jugglekeys

Enjoy !
